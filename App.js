<b>What is the process of Harvesting?</b>
Barely
<c> Large crops of barely are usually harvested with large machinery such as 
  tractors, but for small amounts of barley manual labour is best.
  Tractor-driven combines used a shaker for grain separation, and a straw-walker would remove the straw. 
  They were developed to have independent engines to power the grain separation
   parts and gradually evolved into the combines we see today.</c>
<d>Wheat</d>
<e>
When the wheat is ready, dry and fully ripened, the farmer uses a combine harvesting machine to collect the ripe grain.
The harvester pours the grain into trucks.
The combine harvester is driven through the paddocks where it cuts the wheat, 
cleans and separates the seeds or kernels from the rest of the plant.
